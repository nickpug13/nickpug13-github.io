<h1> GREG ORMOT </h1> 
<h4> Lead singer and rhythm guitarist of Pigeons Playing Ping Pong and solo preformer under the name Scrambling Greg. 
Greg incorperates a fari amount of comedyinto his preformances and works hard to keep the crowd on its toes and feeling good.
Greg comments on his music saying,
"All I want to do is make people smile when we play. No matter what size the crowd. The bigger the crowd the more energy is in the room, and that can 
result in a really incredible experience. But even a tiny crowd is something I look forward to, because people who go to see live music go to turn 
off their minds a little bit and connect on an innately subconscious and incredible level. We just want to spread that as much as possible." Greg has been preforming 
with Pigeons for 8 years and they have been touring the country for 5 years now. His mission is to spread high energy psychedelic funk and good vibes. hoping to leave everyone involved
a happir person. Some of the best advice Greg says he has ever been given is 
"Keep having fun, working hard and trust your gut" </h4>
